Introduction
============

pakchois is yet-another PKCS#11 wrapper library.  pakchois provides a
very thin wrapper over the PKCS#11 interface.

The goals are:

1) to offer a modern* object-oriented C interface based on PKCS#11.

2) to not hide or abstract away any details of the PKCS#11 interface
itself except where absolutely necessary.

3) to handle the details of loading DSOs

4) to allow the caller to avoid caring about where on the system
PKCS#11 modules might be stored, or how they are named.

5) to avoid any dependency on a particular cryptography toolkit.

Existing equivalent solutions differ in at least one of the above
goals.

*: "modern" being a euphemism for "not crap"; i.e. no global state,
 sane symbol namespace, etc etc.


Etymology
=========

"pakchois" is prounounced like the vegetable, "Pak Choi", with a
silent "s"; the word is pluralized only to make the acronym fit;
PaKChoiS, geddit?  In this way the time-honoured tradition of naming
projects by grepping /usr/{share/,}dict/words is continued.
